# Snowflake

Snowflake is Medium's tool for planning and supporting our engineers' career development. You can read more
about how we they use this tool in our [growth framework documentation]. I have built from this to allow for records to be saved, calculate a specified teams average and allow all of the stored records to be viewed in a table.

## Installation

`npm install -g yarn`
